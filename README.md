Hello

Thanks for having a look here!

This is a small program I came up with recently.
The task is to check, if a given word is contained in a given number.

For example the number 3667688 contains the word "foo", which is the equivalent of the number 366.

The idea stands behind the T9 dictionary - words are being transformed into numbers 
according to the schema of a standard phone pad (2-abc, 3-def, 4-ghi etc.).

Thanks!
